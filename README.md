PixelCat is a platform escape game designed and Developed by Andres Ochoa and Trix Mostert :+1:

The MVP is a classic 80's arcade style game with the hero (pixelcat) having to collect items (inventory) to escape the kitchen that belongs to the villain. He also has to dodge obstacles. :laughing:

The Code was written in Javascript, HTML and CSS and it is playable in the browser.
We followed an Iterative development cycle and used the Github's Kanban board to manage workflow and manage our to-do items. 

------
What we have achived and what we still want to achieve:

- [x] Designed and developed a playable game with a well defined MVP
- [x] Worked as a team using Github: branches, merging changes, Kanban board
- [x] [Deployment on github pages](https://isogramc.github.io/pixelcat/)
- [x] Worked using OOP principles and Implemented Classes in Javascript
- [x] Designed all game assets and soundfiles that works with the chosen theme
- [ ] The game lends itself to the educational category - play to e.g. learn english words (inventory item names). This can be developed further.
- [ ] The game has been designed so that more assets can easily be added (obstacles and collectable tokens) - this can easily be achieved and can extend the game even further. More levels and difficulty layers could also with be added with ease in future.
